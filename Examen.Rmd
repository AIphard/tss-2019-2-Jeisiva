This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("dplyr")
install.packages("gapminder")
library("tidyverse")
library("dplyr")
library("gapminder")

```

1.- Create a numeric vector that contains the eight planets of our solar system. Then, create another vector containing the name for each planet (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune). After that, you should assign the number of the planet and its respective name. Finally, you should select and print the planets related to the names Earth, Mars, and Jupiter.

```{r}
planets <- as.numeric(c(1:8))

planets
```


2.- Construct a matrix with 10 rows containing the numbers 1 up to 50, filled row-wise.

```{r}
numbers <- matrix(1:50, nrow = 10, byrow = TRUE)
numbers
```


3.-Create a factor with these observations "Breakfast", "Breakfast", "Breakfast", "Luch", "Luch", "Dinner", "Dinner", "Dinner", "Collation", "Collation", "Collation" and print a summary.

```{r}
lunches <- c("Breakfast", "Breakfast", "Breakfast", "Luch", "Luch", "Dinner", "Dinner", "Dinner", "Collation", "Collation", "Collation")
lunches_factor <- factor(lunches)
lunches_factor
str(lunches_factor)
```


4.- Create and print a data frame that should contain:

5 of your courses (e.g. Fundamentals of Programming, Object-Oriented Programming, Databases, etc ).
5 of your marks
5 of your professors' names


```{r}
courses <- c("Topicos", "Innovacion", "Programacion", "Calculo", "Fisica")
marks <- c(8, 9.2, 7, 8.7, 7.3)
prof_name <- c("Alan Ponce", "Abraham Lopez", "Vicente (porque me gusta mas el apellido:) Jimenez", "Oscar Matrinez", "Gilberto Rivera")
univer_df <- data.frame(courses, marks, prof_name)
univer_df
```

5.- Load the dataset labeled as odb.csv that is located in the data folder and storage this dataset in a variable called od. Then, you should describe the composition of the dataset. This description must contain the number of observations, variables and the type of each variable.

```{r}
od <- odb
str(od)

#For this dataset there is 35 variables and 548 observations, it has integers, factors and numeric values in the data.
#Is that it? ^^^^ idk
```


6.- Filter the od dataset to retrieve only the observation from Mexico, grouped by year and in descending order selecting the "ODB_Rank column

```{r}
od %>% filter(Economy == "Mexico") %>% arrange(desc(year)) %>% select(ODB_Rank)

```


7.- Create a new variable called od_year grouping per "year" and "Income group" variables. Then, remove NAs observations. Later, using the function summarize() you should estimate the median of the GDP_PPP variable and store it in a variable called "medianValue"

```{r}
od_year<- odb %>% group_by(year, Income.group) %>% summarize(medianValue = median(GDP_PPP))
na.omit(od_year)
```


8.-Create a line plot graph to visualize trends over time. You should use the variables created in the od_year data frame using Income group as color

```{r}
ggplot(od_year, aes(x = year, y = Income.group, color = Income.group)) + geom_area()
#I think the first looks better,but in case you ask here is the line one:
#ggplot(od_year, aes(x = Income.group, y = year, color = Income.group)) + geom_line()

```


9.- Create a new variable called od_latin filtering per Region, selecting Latin America & Caribbean and grouping per Income group.

Then, using this data frame, create a plot visualizing the relationship between Individuals_using_Internet and GDP_PPP colored per Income group and faceting per Economy

```{r}
od_latin <- odb %>% filter(Region == "Latin America & Caribbean") %>% group_by(Income.group)
od_latin

ggplot(od_latin, aes(x = Individuals_using_Internet, y = GDP_PPP, color = Income.group)) + geom_point() + facet_wrap(~Economy)
```


10.- Create a new variable called od_2016 filtering the year 2016 and removing observations that contain NAs.

Then, using this data frame, create a plot visualizing the relationship between Technological adoption and GDP_PPP, colored per Income group. Furthermore, you should use a log scale in both axes ("x" and "y"). Finally, you should use the facet function in order to wrap by Region.

```{r}
od_2016 <- odb %>% filter(year == 2016)

ggplot(od_latin, aes(x = Technological_adoption, y = GDP_PPP, color = Income.group)) + scale_x_log10() + scale_y_log10() + geom_point() + facet_wrap(~Region)

```
